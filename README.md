# Icarus

Icarus is an experimental general-purpose programming language, designed to be
fast to compile, fast to run, and easy to migrate.

## Building Icarus from Source

Compiling from source requires one of the following compilers:

* g++ version >= 8.3.0
* clang++ version >= 9.0.0

You will also need [Bazel](http://bazel.build) version >= 2.0.0.

To compile, this project from source,

```
$ git clone https://github.com/asoffer/Icarus.git
$ cd Icarus
$ bazel build -c opt :icarus
```
